		<p>Banksy is a notorious and anonymous street artist, known for his political and highly stylistic graffiti compositions that appear randomly across the world. As a well known artist, his work has inspired numerous street artists to imitate his style -- as a result, over time it has become harder and harder to tell whether a work of street art is a genuine “Banksy” or simply an imitation. For instance, consider the image above. This piece of street art in Boston, Massachusetts is stylistically similar to a Banksy work, but is it legitimately the work of Banksy, or merely a copy?
		<br><br>
		In my opinion, this is not a true Banksy. Firstly, Banksy is well-known not only for his style, but the political messages contained in his artwork. In this work of graffiti, a boy holds a can of red spray paint, implying that he spray painted the nearby graffiti message that reads “I <3 BOSTON” with a red heart. This is hardly a political message, but rather a surface-level piece of Boston-related media. Secondly, Banksy is a world-renowned graffiti artist based in Europe; it seems highly unlikely that he would choose a random University outside of Boston as a place to leave his artwork. Finally, there is the fact that just around the corner on Huntington avenue, there is another piece of street art in this exact same style: a boy holding his knees and watching butterflies. Banksy wouldn’t leave 2 seemingly unrelated pieces of art in such close proximity -- doing this would devalue the rarity and exclusivity of his art. Thus, they are both likely to be fakes.</p>
